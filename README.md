# CS219-Assignment1

This executable opens and reads a .txt file that, when given an operation and two values in hex form, completes the operation and displays the value in hex form. If the sum is smaller than either addend, a message will be displayed indicating that an overflow has occurred. 

Each individual line is read and the operation and two hex values are stored as "operation" and "hex, hex2" of the "Hex class" Adding and displaying all occur before the next line is read. This process occurs until "eof" is reached.

Other than the .txt file, there is no input on the users part.
